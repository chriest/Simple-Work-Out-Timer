# Simple Work Out Timer

## Why?
First version of a simple timer optimized for workout sessions, with features like visual signals, auto snooze, reps and sets counter and many more quality of life improving things over your phone's standard timer. It has been requested by fitness-enthusiast friends, so it's being developed with active feedback in mind.

It's currently being rebuilt natively in Swift and Kotlin due to better compatibility with system API's and better design choices overall. This is here just because my Github would have only been a glorified backup for all my private projects if not and the public tab felt empty. When I'll have something more interesting to share this will go.

## How to Run

Honestly it's just a very unorganized Dart project, just clone it and enjoy I guess. But my advice would be against it.
